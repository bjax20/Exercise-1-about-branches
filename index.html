        <h2>About me: </h2>
        <p>
            My favorite subject is CMSC 12 because Python is easy. This is also the reason why Python is my favorite PL because of its simplicity. Moreover, my 
            favorite GE is Ethics 1 because it challenges my idea about morality. And when I am hungry, my favorite food to eat is fried chicken.
